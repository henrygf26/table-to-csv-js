<p>Author: henrygf26</p>
<p>the JavaScript file is used to export an html table to csv.<br />
In the html insert the following line:<br />
&lt;script type = &quot;text / javascript&quot; src = &quot;[folder] /table_convert_csv.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/ script&gt;<br />
[folder] is the path where the javascript was saved</p>

<p>The function is called exportTableToCSV ([table], [name]);<br />
[table] is the name of the table you want to export<br />
[name] is the name that the file is downloaded</p>
