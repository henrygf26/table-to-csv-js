Convert table to csv using only JavaScript

Autor: henrygf26
The JavaScript file (convert_table_to_csv.js) is used to export an html table to csv.
In the html insert the following line:
<script type = "text / javascript" src = "[folder] /table_convert_csv.js"> </ script>
[folder] is the path where the javascript was saved

The function is called exportTableToCSV ([table], [name]);
[table] is the name of the table you want to export
[name] is the name that the file is downloaded
